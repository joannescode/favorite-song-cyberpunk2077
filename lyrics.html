    <h4>Lyrics</h4>
    <pre>
        I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboard
        But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign
        Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
        Because I miss you all the time

        So, get away
        Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
        And let yourself go
        You know you didn't lose your self-control
        Let's start at the rainbow
        Turn away
        Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
        And let yourself go
        Is that a compromise?

        So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
        'Cause <b><i>I really wanna stay at your house</b></i>
        And I hope it all works out
        But you know how much you broke me apart
        I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
        I don't wanna know, ahh

        And I'm awar–µ that you were lying in the gutter
        'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
        So when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies
        And why do I still wanna call you (call you, call you, call you)

        So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
        'Cause <b><i>I really wanna stay at your house</b></i>
        And I hope it all works out
        But you know how much you broke me apart
        I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
        I don't wanna know

        Ohh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
        I don't know why I'm no one

        So, get away
        Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
        And let yourself go
        You know you didn't lose your self-control
        Let's start at the rainbow
        Turn away
        Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
        And let yourself go
        Is that a compromise?

        So what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
        'Cause <b><i>I really wanna stay at your house</b></i>
        And I hope it all works out
        But you know how much you broke me apart
        I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
        I don't wanna know
