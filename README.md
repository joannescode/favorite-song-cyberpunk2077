# HTML Basics - My favorite song from Cyberpunk 2077 and Edgerunners

My first repository from HTML studies and coding. I used knowledge from [HTML & CSS Full Course for free ðŸŒŽ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw&list=WL&index=7&t=2611s) by Bro Code in this project.

**Key takeaways:**
- HTML is the foundation for any website;
- CSS is for decoration and design of the website;
- Generally, servers return `index.html` as the home page;
- Every HTML document starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`;
- The base structure starts with: `<head></head> <title></title> <body></body> <content></content>`;
- It's a good practice to use `alt` descriptions for images, videos, audios, and other media sources;
- You can add videos and audios using `<audio></audio>` and `<video></video>`;
- Favicon is nice for your website, using `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">` for this;
- The `<span></span>` element is used when you want to style inline content;
- The `<div></div>` element is used when you want to style a block of content;
- There are three types of lists in HTML: unordered lists (`<ul></ul>`), ordered lists (`<ol></ol>`), and description lists (`<dl></dl>`);
- To create tables, use `<table></table>`, and inside the table add `<tr></tr>` for rows with `<td></td>` for cells or `<th></th>` for headers.
